                              <p>As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to a health check prior to boarding.</p>
                              <p>You will not be permitted to board if you:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>show any symptoms of COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
                                 <li>have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19 <strong>or</strong>
                                 </li>
                                 <li>are subject to a provincial or local public health order</li>

                              <p>This also applies to travellers arriving from <strong>outside Canada</strong>.</p>
                              <p>If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you may board a connecting flight to your
                                 destination. However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will
                                 isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting
                                 others.</p>
                              <p>You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health measures at your final destination.</p>
                              <p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will <strong>not</strong> be allowed to board any flight until:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>14 days have passed <strong>or</strong></li>
                                 <li>you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19</li>

                              <p>If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to
                                 travel to the place where you will isolate.</p>

                              <h3 id="non-essential">Avoid all non-essential travel</h3>
                              <p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of Canada advises that you <strong>avoid all non-essential travel
                                    outside of Canada</strong> until further notice.</p>
                              <p>Many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions, such as movement restrictions and quarantines.</p>
                              <p>Many airlines are suspending flights. Many airports are closing, preventing flights from leaving. Exit bans are
                                 becoming more frequent.</p>
                              <p>New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted and you may be
                                 forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected. Canadian travellers should return to Canada as soon as
                                 possible.</p>
                              <p>Making the choice to stay at home and not travel outside of Canada is the best way to protect yourself, your family
                                 and the most vulnerable groups in our communities from COVID-19. Contact your airline or tour operator to determine
                                 options for cancelling or postponing your trip.</p>
                              <p>If you are still considering travel outside of Canada, you should do the following:</p>
                              <ul>
                                 <li>check the <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">pandemic COVID-19

                                 <li>understand the risks of your <a href="#s">safety and security abroad</a></li>
                                 <li>ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are
                                    disrupted</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>It is important to remember that if you travel abroad, you could be subject to the measures of other countries. Your
                                 1-week trip may become much longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care.</p>

                              <p>The Government of Canada is <strong>advising that you avoid all travel on cruise ships</strong> due to the ongoing

                              <p>Cruise passengers include travellers from around the world who may be arriving from areas with known or unknown
                                 spread of COVID-19. The virus can spread quickly on board cruises due to the close contact between passengers. Older
                                 people and people with a weakened immune system or underlying medical condition are at a higher risk of developing
                                 severe disease.</p>
                              <p>Recent cruise ship outbreaks of COVID-19 indicate that a large number of individuals onboard can become infected.
                                 While the majority of affected passengers may experience mild symptoms, there have been a
                                 <strong>significant</strong> number of cases requiring hospitalization and <strong>critical care</strong>, and some
                                 deaths have been reported.</p>
                              <p>As the COVID-19 situation evolves, many countries outside of Canada are implementing policies and restrictions in
                                 order to contain the global outbreak. These restrictions may impact a cruise traveller's:</p>
                              <ul>

                                 <li>upon return to Canada, you will be required to remain in mandatory isolation for 14 days at a location determined
