               <p>As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to a health check prior to boarding.</p>
               <p>You will not be permitted to board if you:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>show any symptoms of COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
                  <li>have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19 <strong>or</strong>
                  </li>
                  <li>are subject to a provincial or local public health order</li>
               </ul>
               <p>This also applies to travellers arriving from <strong>outside Canada</strong>.</p>

               <p>If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you may board a connecting flight to your
                  destination. However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will
                  isolate, and remain there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting
                  others.</p>
               <p>You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health measures at your final destination.</p>
               <p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will <strong>not</strong> be allowed to board any flight until:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>14 days have passed <strong>or</strong></li>
                  <li>you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to
                  travel to the place where you will isolate.</p>

               <h3 id="non-essential">Avoid all non-essential travel</h3>
               <p>To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of Canada advises that you <strong>avoid all non-essential travel
                     outside of Canada</strong> until further notice.</p>
               <p>Many countries have put in place travel or border restrictions, such as movement restrictions and quarantines.</p>
               <p>Many airlines are suspending flights. Many airports are closing, preventing flights from leaving. Exit bans are
                  becoming more frequent.</p>
               <p>New restrictions may be imposed with little warning. Your travel plans may be severely disrupted and you may be
                  forced to remain outside of Canada longer than expected. Canadian travellers should return to Canada as soon as
                  possible.</p>
               <p>Making the choice to stay at home and not travel outside of Canada is the best way to protect yourself, your family
                  and the most vulnerable groups in our communities from COVID-19. Contact your airline or tour operator to determine
                  options for cancelling or postponing your trip.</p>
               <p>If you are still considering travel outside of Canada, you should do the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>check the <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221">pandemic COVID-19
                        travel health notice</a> before travelling and know the health risks for your destination</li>
                  <li>understand the risks of your <a href="#s">safety and security abroad</a></li>
                  <li>ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are
                     disrupted</li>
               </ul>
               <p>It is important to remember that if you travel abroad, you could be subject to the measures of other countries. Your
                  1-week trip may become much longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care.</p>

               <p>If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border

               <p>If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this
                  information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the <em>Quarantine
                     Act</em>. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.</p>
               <p>You will see messaging on arrivals screens at international airports to help guide you if you are experiencing
                  flu-like symptoms.</p>
               <p>Arriving travellers will also be provided with information on what symptoms to identify and how to <a

               <p>While the Government of Canada advises that you <strong>avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada</strong>,
                  there may be times when travel is essential.</p>

               <p>If you do travel outside Canada, you should expect increased health screening measures at points of entry for
                  international destinations, including airports and land borders. Local authorities may impose control measures
                  suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantines.</p> -->
