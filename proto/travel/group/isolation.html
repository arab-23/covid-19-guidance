<h4>Request a quarantine exemption</h4>

<p>Although you may have a compassionate and compelling reason, you <strong>cannot</strong> be exempted from a 14 day quarantine for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a visit to a sick or dying relative</li>
    <li>a funeral</li>
    <li>non-essential work</li>
    <li>non-essential reasons</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe you are entering Canada for another <strong>essential reason</strong> not outline in the Emergency Order and you cannot plan for a 14 day quarantine, you will require an exemption.</p>
<details><summary>How to request a quarantine exemption</summary>

<p>To complete a quarantine exemption request, email us at: <a
    href="mailto:phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.caphac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca">phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca</a>.
</p>
<p> To support your request you must include the following information, at minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of travellers and country of citizenship of each traveller</li>
    <li>planned travel dates</li>
    <li>specific purpose for travel to Canada</li>
    <li>an explanation as to why you are of the view that you qualify for exemption and are unable to plan for a 14 day
        quarantine</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the Canada Border Services Agency is responsible for the administration of Emergency Orders made
    under the Quarantine Act at Canada's points of entry. As such, entry to Canada (and subsequent public health
    measures) is permitted at the discretion of a Border Services Officer who is required to weigh the evidence present
    at the time of entry against reasonableness and the overall risks to public health.

<h2 id="complying">Complying with the emergency order</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada has put in place an <a
        href="https://orders-in-council.canada.ca/attachment.php?attach=38989&amp;lang=en">Emergency Order</a> under the
    <em><a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Q-1.1/index.html">Quarantine Act</em></a>. It applies to all travellers arriving in Canada. Its purpose is to slow the spread of
    COVID-19 in Canada.</p>
    <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the <em>Quarantine Act</em> and could lead to <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.</p>

    <details><summary>How to comply when you arrive in Canada</summary>
        <p>If you are permitted to enter Canada, you will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>asked if you have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing</li>
            <li>required to acknowledge that you must:
                <ul>
                    <li>isolate for 14 days if you have symptoms of COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
                    <li>quarantine (self-isolate) for 14 days if you do not have symptoms</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>asked if you have a suitable place to isolate or quarantine (self-isolate)
                <ul>
                    <li>a suitable place is one where you will have basic necessities, such as food and medication, and where
                        you will not have contact with vulnerable people</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>given instructions about your obligations under the Emergency Order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ArriveCAN mobile application (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canarrive/id1505394667?mt=8"
                rel="external">iOS</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.gc.cbsa.coronavirus"

            <li>facilitates compliance with the <em>Quarantine Act</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Violating any instructions provided to you when you entered Canada is an offence under the <em>Quarantine Act</em>
            and could lead to up to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 months in prison <strong>and/or</strong></li>
            <li>$750,000 in fines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Further, a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm to another person while wilfully or
            recklessly contravening this act or the regulations could be liable for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a fine of up to $1,000,000 <strong>or</strong></li>
            <li>imprisonment of up to 3 years <strong>or</strong></li>
            <li>both</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <em>Contraventions Act</em> has been changed to give police (including RCMP, provincial and local police) more
            power to enforce the <em>Quarantine Act</em>. They can now issue tickets to people who do not comply with the act.
            Fines range from $275 to $1000.</p>

            <p>To better understand the roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial and territorial governments and law
                enforcement agencies with
                compliance and enforcement, see <a
