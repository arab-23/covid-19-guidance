                  <p>For periods 5 and 6, if you have an <a href="">eligible revenue drop</a> of at least 30%, you are entitled to the higher CEWS rate between two calculation options:</p>

                     <li>the amount calculated using the rules for the current period (period 5 or 6), or </li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>This means that in periods 5 and 6, if you had a revenue decline of 30% or more, you would receive an overall CEWS rate of at least 75%.</p>
