               <h2 id="h-1">Who are eligible employees</h2>
               <p>An eligible employee is a person who was employed by you (the eligible employer) in Canada during the claim period.</p>
               <p>For <strong>claim periods 1 to 4</strong>, you can’t include employees who had 14 or more consecutive unpaid days in the period. However, <strong>for periods 5 and later</strong>, you no longer have to exclude these employees from your calculation.</p>
               <p>Employee eligibility depends on the person being <strong>employed</strong> in Canada, not living in Canada.</p>
               <h3 id="retro">Retroactively hiring and paying employees</h3>
               <p>Employees you laid off can become eligible retroactively, as long as you rehire and pay them so they meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire and pay these employees before you include them in your subsidy claim.</p>

                  <summary>Eligible employees and the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB)</summary>
                  <p>People you rehired may have received, or continue to receive, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). Depending on the specific situation, these employees may be required to repay some or all of the CERB they received.</p>
                  <p>CERB recipients who already know they will need to repay the CERB can <a href=

               <div id="nonarm-cntnt">
                  <p>You will be asked whether an employee is arm’s length or not when you calculate your subsidy amount, because the CEWS is calculated differently for eligible non-arm’s-length and arm’s-length employees.</p>
                  <p>In a small business, a <strong>non-arm’s-length</strong> employee would most commonly be:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>a business owner</li>
                     <li>a member of an owner’s immediate family (for example, a spouse, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>It’s possible (but less common) for a non-arm’s-length employee relationship to exist between unrelated people, depending on the circumstances. </p>
                  <p>For most small businesses, workers are usually <strong>arm’s-length</strong> employees unless they are an owner or an owner’s family member.</p>
                  <p>If you’re not sure about whether an employee is considered arm’s length or non-arm’s length, or have a business involving more complex control (like a corporation, trust, or partnership), you can read more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/series-1-individuals/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">specific relationships that are considered non-arm’s length</a>.</p>

                     <dt>Employees on leave with pay</dt>
                     <dd>Are those who were temporarily furloughed but receiving pay for at least a full week in a claim period. Employees on leave with pay:
                        <ul><li>received full or partial pay during the week</li>
                           <li>did <strong>not</strong> work at all during the week</li>

                  </dl>
                  <p><strong>For claim periods 5 to 9</strong>, employees who were on leave with pay are treated differently than actively working employees when calculating your subsidy amount. The amount for employees in either situation from week to week is determined automatically when you use the <a href="how-much.html#h-3">online calculator or spreadsheet</a>.</p>
                  <p>Or, you can read the <mark>in-depth information about how the wage subsidy is calculated for employees on leave with pay</mark>.</p>
                  <p><strong>For all claim periods 1 to 9</strong>, you can claim a 100% refund of the employer-paid part of contributions made on behalf of any eligible employees who are on leave with pay for any full week within the claim period.</p>
                  <p>The employer-paid contributions that can be refunded for employees on leave with pay for the week include:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Employment Insurance (EI)</li>
                     <li>the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)</li>

                  <summary>Example of choosing an employee’s pre-crisis pay amount</summary>
                  <p>ADC Ltd. is preparing to claim the subsidy for period 5. Their employee Issa was paid $8,000 from January 1 to March 15, 2020, and $21,000 from July 1, 2019, to December 21, 2019. Issa was off work without pay from December 2, 2019, to January 15, 2020 (inclusive).</p>
                  <p>Calculating Issa’s pre-crisis pay for January 1 to March 15, 2020 (pre-crisis pay period option 1)</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Total pay for this period: $8000</li>
                     <li>Days in claim period (75) minus consecutive days in this period without pay (15) = 60
                     <li>Weekly average using pre-crisis pay period option 1: ($8000/60)*7=$933.33</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Calculating Issa’s pre-crisis pay for July 1 to December 21, 2019 (pre-crisis pay period option 2)</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Total pay for this period = $21,000</li>
                     <li>Days in claim period (184) minus consecutive days without pay (30) = 154</li>
                     <li>Weekly average using pre-crisis pay period option 2: ($21,000/154)*7 = $954.55</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>ADC Ltd. should use pre-crisis pay period of July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019 (option 2) for Issa because it results in the higher weekly average.</p>
