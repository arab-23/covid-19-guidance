    <p>The CRA has provided convenient ways for you to get the CERB as quickly as possible. But your situation may have changed since you first applied, and we need to ensure that the CERB is kept only by people who are eligible.</p>
    <p>You must repay the <strong>$2,000</strong> CERB payment in full if you no longer meet the eligibility requirements for the 4-week period in question. </p>

              <p>Having to repay or not will  depend on if you continue to meet the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/benefits/apply-for-cerb-with-cra/who-apply.html#eligibility-criteria">eligibility  criteria</a> for that period. <br>

      <summary>Alternative format: Determine if you need to repay the CERB to the CRA</summary>
      <p class="h3 mrgn-tp-0">Repayment scenarios</p>
      <p>This could happen if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you earned employment or self-employment income earlier than expected</li>
        <li>you applied for the CERB but later realize you’re not eligible</li>
        <li>you receive a CERB payment from both Service Canada and the CRA for the same period</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="h4">If you applied for the CERB twice in one period</p>
      <p>If you applied for the CERB or EI with Service Canada, and then later applied for the CERB with the CRA for the same eligibility period, you applied twice. If this happens, you will have to return or repay the overpayment.</p>
      <p class="h4">Do I have to repay my CERB if I get rehired or find a new job?</p>
      <p>You are required to repay the CERB if you no longer meet the eligibility requirements for the 4-week period in question. For example, you applied for the 4-week period of April 12 to May 9. At the time you applied, you expected to have little or no work or income for that 4-week period. But you have just found out your employer has rehired you and will give you back-pay for that same 4-week period. In this situation, you will need to repay the CERB for that 4-week period of April 12 to May 9.</p>
      <p class="h3 mrgn-tp-0">Repayment conditions</p>
      <p>The conditions around paying back the CERB are different if you’re paying back your first eligibility period, or a subsequent period.</p>
      <p class="h4">For your first eligibility period</p>
      <p>If your employment or self-employment income was $1,000 or less (before deductions) for at least 14 days in a row during this 4-week period, you do not need to repay the CERB.</p>
      <p class="h4">For subsequent eligibility periods</p>
      <p>You will need to repay the $2,000 for an eligibility period if you earned or will earn more than $1,000 (before deductions) from employment or self-employment income during that period.</p>
